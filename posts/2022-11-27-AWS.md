# AWS re:Invent 2022 | Day 1 - Sunday, Nov. 27

## Badge pickup

Today I woke up very early - 5 am! I am still jetlagged :) so I used this time to take a look into [map](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/?trk=direct#map) and see what I have going on around me. Luckily for me, I am at the Flamingo Hotel that is at the center of the Strip and I can see many things 
[around](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/?trk=direct#venue).

The badge pickup started at 12:00 am at MGM or Venetian, but I was so close to the Venetian that I decided to go to go on foot to MGM.

Until then, walking on the strip I was like a child trying to see everything and taking pictures everywhere.
I don't know how many casinos I went through but it showed me that in every corner we have a casino.
I think most of them that I went through were by mistake :D

Arriving at the MGM I didn't expect to walk that far to be at the conference center, I think I walked 15 min. The MGM is so big! (Iâ€™ve just realized that everything is so big that I think I will use this word a lot)

Entering the conference center I could see this event is very well organized and has a lot of security (including dogs) and many volunteers.

The queue was so long that I couldn't see the end! After three corners I was there.

## SWAG pickup

I decided to go to the hotels where we will have the sessions to understand how to get there. So, at The Mandalay Bay, which is the farthest hotel, I took a shuttle to the Venetian to pickup the Swag and while I was there I had the opportunity to meet some people.

So I meet a guy who is an electrical engineer in the government healthcare. So he is responsible for having a good infrastructure in place. We talked about the architecture and which kind of services he used from AWS.

He needs to collect all the patient data, such as their name, address, patient history, phone number etc. In the whole network, there is more than 100 terabytes of data.
So his architecture is based on event driven using kafka and elasticsearch and he uses Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.

For each form that is filled in he sends an event to the kafka and then goes to elastic on DynamoDB. He mentioned that it is important to have a good index but DynamoDB works very well and when we wants to write some reports, for a few terabytes it is less than 1 min!!

Arriving in Venetian I went through the "main" conference center, where most of the keynotes will happen, to pick up the SWAG.

We had a place to check our size and then another space to pick up.

Outside of this arena there were a few entertaining spots, including a big blackboard where anyone could leave their message or word.

Of course I had to write something...
