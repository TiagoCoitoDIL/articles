# AWS re:Invent 2022 | Day 5 - Thursday, Dec. 1



## Dr. Werner Vogels Keynote

Join Dr. Werner Vogels, Amazon.com VP and CTO, as he shows how customers and AWS are using novel architectural patterns to build scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant applications. He highlights innovations and emerging technologies that enable builders to create systems that would have been previously unimaginable and describes how the cloud is at the center of this new era of innovation.

In this workshop we learned how to build a DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline with security and compliance testing integrated into the development process. 

We used GitHub Actions to integrate [AWS CloudFormation Guard (cfn-guard)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cfn-guard/latest/ug/what-is-guard.html) to run policy validations and ensure that pipeline deployments are consistent and that they meet organization's compliance standards. More AWS for GitHub Actions can been found [here](https://github.com/aws-actions).

For the workshop, we followed a tutorial to create the three stages (build, compliance and deploy) for the pipeline in this Architecture.

## Preserving and maximizing the value of digital media assets using Amazon S3


In this sessions we talk about 3 main points using S3 bucket

1 - Managing exponential growth
The data is all around us even in our pocket taking photo, Stream services and image how the content is beeing generated 

There are a mass of amount of data that we are alwauts using.
101zb of data created and replicated in the world in 2022.

There is a lot of data to store and we are alwats try to think how we should store them.

There are a lot of data, and most of the data is cold.. Mean we don't using so often. 


Many users com to s3 to manage their data.
Amazon s3 archival storage classes. -> ver imagem

Thre pupose glacier

S3 glacier instant retrieval - retrieve data that we are not using to often

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval - flexiblilty, 

S3 Glacier Deep Archive - truly cold data

2 - Preserving your most princeless assets

- Preserving, and sage the data

S3 performs over 4 billion checksum computations per second, 


3 - Maximizing the value of archival data

1 PB restored every day from S3 Glacier


unlocking the potentail of your data


We have the opportunity to ear some example this use


->Warner Bros. Discovery https://wbd.com/

They start to digitization fisical films to be durable a long the years.

They innovate has they should store, but have to use AWS


thaking advantages of data the that has been perserved
