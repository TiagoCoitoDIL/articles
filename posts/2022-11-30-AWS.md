# AWS re:Invent 2022 | Day 4 - Sunday, Nov. 30


## Breakfast at Venetian

Every time that I came to this hotel I always dicovery news things. 

Today I came here for breakfast and I found an eating zone bigger than MGM.
MGM for me was huge but here in Venetian is even bigger!

## Deep learning with Amazon SageMaker, AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia

Lakshmi Ramakrishnan - Principal Engineer - Amazon Sagemaker AWS
K.C. Tung - Sr. Solutions Architect - Annapurna Labs ML AWS

![SageMaker Session](../Images/AWS/day4/IMG_8588.jpg)

This workshop started by introducing [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/), a powerful IDE for Machine Learning. We can do everything such as developing, building, training, and deploying our ML models without ever leaving the IDE.

![SageMaker](../Images/AWS/day4/IMG_8591.jpg)

The reason why SageMaker is so powerful is because behind it uses two instances of AWS:
Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances, powered by [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/), and EC2 Inf1 instances, powered by [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/).
Trn1 and Inf1 have very good hardware in the cloud for ML purposes.

Now that we know what SageMaker is and what it does, it was time to start the workshop.
The goal is when we send a sentence to the endpoint, the model trained, will predict the sentiment of the input sentence using an IMDB dataset with sentences labeled to be either positive or negative sentiment.

We [cloned](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-trainium-inferentia), a project into sagemaker and we followed the python [script](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-trainium-inferentia/blob/main/HFbertdemo.ipynb) to show how to train a text classification model with AWS Trainium and then deploy it in AWS Inferentia.

We used a pretrained [BERT model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased?text=Paris+is+the+%5BMASK%5D+of+France.) and fine-tune it with IMDB dataset.
The training job will be made on ml.trn1 instance which hosts the AWS Trainium accelerator and then the trained model weights will be deployed in an endpoint in ml.inf1 instance which hosts the AWS Inferentia accelerator.
We have been using Amazon S3 to save a get the ML models.

At the end we are able to play a little bit and predict some sentences :)

In this session was also mentioned the evolution of the hardware from Trn1 and Inf1.
Trn1 instances can save up to 50 percent in training costs and Inf1 for up to 2.3x higher throughput and up to 70 percent lower cost per inference over equivalent GPU-based EC2 instances.

A really nice workshop to get my hands back on ML but this time using SageMaker.For this example we could see how fast the training and the deployment were, and start using the ML model to predict my sentences :)

## Kubernetes and cloud-native data management with Kasten by Veeam (sponsored by Veeam)

Michael Cade - Senior Technologist Kasten by Veeam
Deepika Dixit - Member Technical Staff Kasten by Veeam

![Kubernetes and cloud-native Session](../Images/AWS/day4/IMG_8618.jpg)

The target of this session was for Operation People but was fun to learn a little bit about the infrastructure using [Kasten K10](https://www.kasten.io/) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Kasten K10 is in the AWS marketplace and enables seamless backup and disaster recovery on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [EKS Distro](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-distro/), and Kubernetes distributions such as Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA).

They showed how to deploy the application using kubernetes and [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) to manage the secrets encrypted in AWS.

![Kubernetes and cloud-native Session](../Images/AWS/day4/IMG_8623.jpg)

Kasten also has a pretty good UI that displays all the information that we need including the scalability with multi-cluster dashboards.

They also showed the workload migration and database integrations providing insights into cloud-native data protection using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Object Lock in Amazon S3.

If we are using kubernetes it can be a good tool!

## Developers do care about security: Building a more collaborative path (sponsored by [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html))

Madeline Van Der Paelt - Development Manager

![Developers do care about security](../Images/AWS/day4/IMG_8651.jpeg)

The session started to explain that can be challenging and time-consuming to deliver a modern application that meets security and compliance requirements. 

Developers may be invested in security but many don’t have the knowledge or capacity to be experts. It is because a developer need to worry about a lot of stuff when is developing and security most of the times is not taken with much importance as it should be.


And as Developer we should worry about customer require not everything.

What can we do predeployment?
-> mostrar a imagem 

we need to work together as a team with everybody envolve. Talk with each other. 


DevOps and cognitive capacity
- change the way we devolpe and the role is too much to take care.

- Create good env for the developer so they do what they should do.


Understanding your services
- operation review - check your metrics and operation condintions about your service see what is doing and how is running.

- Things happen in production that we are not expecting to do so is important to see what is going on regulary.


So we use AWS Well-Architected Tool

AWS Serverless Application Lens

How do you manage your AWS accounts

Useful tool - finding common ground

When security teams ask developers to deploy an agent, developer teams may question the value of it, causing friction between the teams. 

In this session, learn from a developer about how developers and security teams at Trend Micro work together to meet security requirements while building a better design pattern to meet the needs of both teams.

## The architect elevator: Connecting the boardroom and IT

We upgrade our technology all the time—isn’t it time to update the role of architects? Today’s successful leaders forge a tight connection between an organization’s strategy, its technology choices, and its operational capabilities. The IT engine room, although equipped with amazing capabilities, can be daunting. That’s why modern architects add value by connecting IT and the boardroom by building executive awareness, clearly communicating technical trade-offs, and facilitating better decision-making. This session redefines the role of the architect for the modern enterprise and teaches technology leaders and architects how they can form a fruitful alliance across the levels of their organization.
