# AWS re:Invent 2022 | Day 4 - Sunday, Nov. 30


## Breakfast at Venetian

Every time that I came to this hotel I dicovery news things. 
First time I came here to pickup my swag and I figure out there is here some enternaing and is the spot for the keynotes. You can image how big it is.. 

Next day I received a notification the Expo has been opened at Venetian, I would thinking "Is there other Pavilion?" and I discovery the expo in the back of the big screens.

Today I came here to breakfast because I have a session in the morning and I found a eat zone even bigger than MGM.
Dam.. is there some much space around here?


Finishing my breakfast was time to walk into the workshop and yes.. another surprise! So many meeting rooms in 3 level that I got lost to find my room. Fornunatly I was early to here.

## Deep learning with Amazon SageMaker, AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia

With Amazon SageMaker you can build, train, and deploy machine learning models for almost any use case. Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances, powered by AWS Trainium, and EC2 Inf1 instances, powered by AWS Inferentia, deliver the best price performance for deep learning training and inference. In this workshop, walk through training a BERT model for natural language processing on Trn1 instances to save up to 50 percent in training costs over equivalent GPU-based EC2 instances. Also learn how to deploy this model for inference on Inf1 instances for up to 2.3x higher throughput and up to 70 percent lower cost per inference than comparable GPU-based EC2 instances. You must bring your laptop to participate.

Thera are two Amazon instances that are acedidos by Sagamaker
that has training chips - both instances are used to work with our module.

Training model is no longer single node there is a distributed systems.

In this workshop we followed a script inside of Safemaker Studio on AWS. just press shit+enter for each line.

We walked through fine-tuning a BERT model for natural language processing on Trn1 instances to save up to 50 percent in training costs over equivalent GPU-based EC2 instances. Also, we deployed this model for inference on Inf1 instances for up to 2.3x higher throughput and up to 70 percent lower cost per inference. Pretty Amazing..

## Kubernetes and cloud-native data management with Kasten by Veeam (sponsored by Veeam)

The target of this session was for Operation People but was fun to learn a little bit about the infrastructure using Kubernetes

The growing popularity of Kubernetes necessitates reliable, cloud-native backup and recovery for Kubernetes workloads across diverse architectures to protect data and applications. 

Available in the AWS marketplace, Kasten K10 enables seamless backup and disaster recovery on Amazon EKS, EKS Distro, and Kubernetes distributions such as Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA).

In this session, explore the simplicity of Kasten K10, learn about the Helm chart, and discover the solution’s scalability with multi-cluster dashboards. 

The session also demonstrates workload migration and database integrations and provides insight into cloud-native data protection using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Object Lock in Amazon S3.

Kasten by Veem - https://www.kasten.io/
- Kubernetes Backup and restore

- mostrar slide Enhanced Amazon EKS Data Protection


Architecture -> mostrar a imagem


Has been made a Demo to show how to deploy the application using kubernetes and helm chart.

Helm chart - https://helm.sh/

and then show how to intregate with kasten on aws and using helm chart it has the secret and also encrypted in AWS.

Kasten has an ui for you be able to see all information that you need 

They use Amazon s3

## Developers do care about security: Building a more collaborative path (sponsored by Trend Micro)

https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html

The session start to talk about what a developer need to worry and when is developing some times the security is not so much important as it should be.

And as Developer we should worry about customer require not everything.

What can we do predeployment?
-> mostrar a imagem 

we need to work together as a team with everybody envolve. Talk with each other. 


DevOps and cognitive capacity
- change the way we devolpe and the role is too much to take care.

- Create good env for the developer so they do what they should do.


Understanding your services
- operation review - check your metrics and operation condintions about your service see what is doing and how is running.

- Things happen in production that we are not expecting to do so is important to see what is going on regulary.


So we use AWS Well-Architected Tool

It can often be challenging and time-consuming to deliver a modern application that meets security and compliance requirements. 

While developers may be invested in security, many don’t have the bandwidth or capacity to be experts. 

When security teams ask developers to deploy an agent, developer teams may question the value of it, causing friction between the teams. 

In this session, learn from a developer about how developers and security teams at Trend Micro work together to meet security requirements while building a better design pattern to meet the needs of both teams.
